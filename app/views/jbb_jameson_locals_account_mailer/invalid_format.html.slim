p The attached Jameson Locals Accounts Lists for this month are not in the proper format. As a reminder, this must include the following columns in this exact order: TDLinx Code, Name, Address, City, State. Please update these files, upload to the FTP server and let us know once complete so that we can manually run the synch process.
