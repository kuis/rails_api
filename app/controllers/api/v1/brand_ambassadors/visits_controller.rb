          Returns a list of visits filtered by the given params.

          The results are returned on groups of 30 per request. To obtain the next 30 results provide the <page> param.

          The dates are returned on the user's timezone.

          *Facets*

          Faceting is a feature of Solr that determines the number of documents that match a given search and an additional criteria.

          When <page> is "1", the result will include a list of facets scoped on the following search params:

          - start_date
          - end_date

          *Facets Results*

          The API returns the facets on the following format:

            [
              {
                label: String,            # Any of: Campaigns, Brands, Location, People, Active State, Event Status
                items: [                  # List of items for the facet sorted by relevance
                  {
                    "label": String,      # The name of the item
                    "id": String,         # The id of the item, this should be used to filter the list by this items
                    "name": String,       # The param name to be use for filtering the list (campaign, user, team, place, area, status, event_status)
                    "count": Number,      # The number of results for this item
                    "selected": Boolean   # True if the list is being filtered by this item
                  },
                  ....
                ],
                top_items: [              # Some facets will return this as a list of items that have the greater number of results
                  <other list of items>
                ]
              }
            ]

          Each visit in the result set has the following attributes:
          * *id*: the visits's ID
          * *visit_type_name*: the visit's type name
          * *start_date*: the visit's start date
